            <h2>Rick Owens</h2>
            <p id="p1">The artist who inspires Kai is the fashion designer Rick Owens. Rick Owens is an American fashion designer who creates avant-garde fashion that the vast majority of the public would describe as either ridiculous or not fitting of what would be socially acceptable to wear in public. Even despite this, year after year, Rick showcases collections that continue to embody his vision which Kai finds to be inspiring.</p>

            <h2>Ecco2k</h2>
            <p id="p2">The second of these artists who inspires Kai is one of his favorite musical artists as of recent Ecco2k. Ecco2k is a Swedish musician who discusses topics such as his experience growing up black in a predominantly white country, his queer identity, and his struggles with addiction. All of these topics are very personal and make up his identity, so Kai finds it really inspiring how he can be vulnerable and put out music that discusses these topics to the public.

            <h2>Wolfgang Tillmans</h2>
            <p id="p3">The third artist who inspires Kai is the German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans. Kai finds Wolfganâ€™s work to be inspiring because he is able to capture photos of everyday things and have them show the viewer the beauty that can be found in simplicity. Being able to give meaning to moments or objects many people would consider to be insignificant or meaningless Kai finds that to be very inspiring.
