            <h2 id="hme">About Kai Torrey</h2>
            <p id="pme">Kai Torrey is a Visual Communication Design student currently studying at San Francisco State University. He is currently in his second year at the school and aspires to become a UX designer after graduation. The core pillars of Kai’s design philosophy are iteration, experimentation, and hard work. He believes that nothing great comes on the first try, so by iterating and going outside of your comfort zone, you will be able to find your best and most authentic work. The second pillar experimentation plays into the same ideas of the first. Experimenting with your designs often leads to you finding outcomes that are exciting and unexpected, leading to powerful and great work. The final pillar, hard work, he believes ties into every aspect of his life including design. He believes that when we put 100% of ourselves into whatever task we are doing, we will find it to be more enjoyable, and rewarding, and the outcome to be greater. When Kai isn’t doing design work, you can find him engaging in some of his hobbies which consist of photography, thrifting, and going out with friends.  He created this webpage to exercise his HTML and CSS skills which he learned in his web design class. On the navigation bar, you will be able to find two more pages, the first being three artists who inspire Kai and the other being 3 lists, the first being the top places on his bucket list, the second being the top locations he has visited, and the third a list of Kai’s top 5 pictures of his beagle Sofie.</p>
