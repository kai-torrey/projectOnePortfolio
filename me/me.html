        <p id="pme">Hello, my name is Kai Torrey and this is my online webpage! I am a Visual Communication Design Student and am currently studying UX and design theory at San Francisco State University. I created this webpage for my web design course to practice my HTML skills and ability to link pages. On the navigation bar, you will be able to find this page with information on me, along with two other pages, one dedicated to three artists who inspire me, and the other dedicated to three top-five lists, featuring the top five destinations I have visited, top five destinations I want to visit, and top five pictures of my pet beagle Sophie. Aside from design, in my free time, I enjoy thrifting for vintage clothing and antiques, going to the movies, hanging out with my friends, and exercising in any way I can. One of my favorite ways to get exercise is going for hikes around different areas in the San Francisco Bay Area. Some of the most memorable hikes I have done in the past few years include, Lake Chabot, Mission Peak, and Mount Tamalpais. I hope that you enjoy learning a bit about me and enjoy the content on my webpage!!</p>
